# Lux

A proof-of-concept web framework written in Rust.

## Goal
Lux is designed to proof that we can develop a small web framework like [koa.js](https://github.com/koajs/koa) and [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). Its goals are to be:

1. Middleware based.
2. Fast.
3. Easy to extend.
4. With a built-in router which can be replaced.
5. Accept both `fn` and `closure`.

## Note
Some code comes from [Thruster](https://github.com/trezm/Thruster) and thanks to it.

This project won't be published until I find a good name and pass the [TechEmpower benchmark](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks).
